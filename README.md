# non-myopic-multi-sensor-multi-Bernoulli-GOSPA-driven-sensor-management
Sensor management code for non-myopic, multi-sensor, multi-Bernoulli GOSPA driven sensor management. Utilising Monte Carlo Tree Search adapted to sensor management and utilising an upper bound on the mean square generalised optimal sub pattern assignment (GOSPA) error to drive the decision making.
